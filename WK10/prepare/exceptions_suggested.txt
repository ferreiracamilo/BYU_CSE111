There are many types of exceptions in Python, but there are only seven types that your code will 
need to handle in CSE 111: TypeError, ValueError, ZeroDivisionError, IndexError, KeyError, FileNotFoundError, and PermissionError. 
When writing code that writes to or reads from a file, a programmer usally writes try and except blocks to handle FileNotFoundError and PermissionError.
Also, when writing code that gets input from a user, a programmer usually writes try and except blocks to help validate the userâ€™s input.
